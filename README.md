## What is PDF Cheatsheets?

Being able to search online for the tools, hotkeys, commands, etc.. can be very useful, but often times I find myself spending longer than needed to find the right hotkey or command. Sometimes it is just more useful to have a peice of paper with common commands that can be run. Sure, commands will change - but a lot of the ones, which are used do not change.

This is where having a printer friendly cheatsheet comes in handy. A nice website, with cool graphics is great, but sometimes you just want a simply, printable PDF. This is where PDF Cheatsheets comes from. All the PDFs are created with no logos or fancy coloring. Just, easy to read files which can be printed and stored on your desk.
